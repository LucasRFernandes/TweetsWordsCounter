- wait until the process is finished, this may take a while depending on your parameters, computing power, or internet speed, but 
should not take tooo long, on my computer, I had a 7 minutes wait time to process 20k tweets

after this is done the program will save the results to a txt file located on the same directory the script was executed
you have the choice to automatically open the txt file containg the results.
